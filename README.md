# GROUPOMANIA

Groupomania is the seventh and last project of my Web Developper formation with Openclassrooms. 
I created a fullstack app which is a social network for an enterprise. It permits the users to:
- Signup
- Login
- Publish a post and remove it
- Comment post and remove these comments
- Delete their account

The application is also provided with an admin user who can :
- Remove posts, comments and accounts

The application must respect OWASP and GDPR norms.
